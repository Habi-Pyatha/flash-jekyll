title: What is the difference between calling super and calling super()?

A call to `super` invokes the parent method with the same arguments that were passed to the child method. An error will therefore occur if the arguments passed to the child method donâ€™t match what the parent is expecting.

A call to `super()` invokes the parent method without any arguments, as presumably expected. As always, being explicit in your code is a good thing.
